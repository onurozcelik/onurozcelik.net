Anyone whose is learning a programming language already knows the above code snippet. This is the defacto example for every programming language. The above snippet is the exact way to say "Hello World" in [Kotlin](http://bit.ly/1WNJrCY).<!--more-->

In recent years, Java Virtual Machine (JVM) languages gain lots of attention among programmers. Kotlin is an another JVM language which has been created by [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com). JetBrains is the company that is the creator of awesome developer tools like [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

Well, why I write a "Hello World" code snippet in Kotlin? Actually, for long years I developed code with C++. Then for some reason, I shifted to Java. While I am investigating Java world I meet with Kotlin and hear Google's decision about Kotlin support on Android platform. I tasted Kotlin's syntax and really liked it. Lastly, I decided to learn Kotlin by teaching it. This post is my first trial to reach my aim.

For those who want to test the above snippet click [Try Kotlin](https://try.kotlinlang.org). See you in my next post.
